# ERNN-Emotion-Recognition-Neural-Network

If you want to run the script, make sure you have these modules installed on your Python 3.9 environment:

pandas
tensorflow
numpy
opencv

After that, download fer2013.csv from this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deadskull7/fer2013

Then, open the .ipynb file on Jupyter Notebook and replace the path in the first cell with your own path to fer2013.csv.
Run the cells in order from first to last. If the kernel crashes, you lower the amount of epochs and also the amount of loaded samples to go easier on your computer.
